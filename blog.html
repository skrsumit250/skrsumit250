            <p id="p2">I am a 19-year-old from Bihar and I am currently a sophomore studying Biotechnology at one of the most prestigious universities in India which is the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati.</p>
            <p id="p2">Aside from Biotechnology, I am very passionate about programming so I have learned many programming languages like C, C++, and Python. One of the areas in which I am most interested is <a id="a2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming">CP(Competitive Programming)</a> which is a mind sport which involves logical or mathematical problems and contestants are required to write computer programs capable of solving each problem.</p>
            <p id="p2">There are various CP platforms such as Codeforces, Codechef, Leetcode, HackerRank, etc. Currently I am 3⭐ star coder on <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/skrsumit250" id="a2">Codechef</a>
            and <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/skrsumit250" id="badge">pupil</a> with maximum rating <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/skrsumit250" id="badge">1247</a> on <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/skrsumit250" id="a2">Codeforces</a>.Also earned 5⭐ Badge for C and C++, and 4⭐ Badge for Problem Solving on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/skrsumit250" id="a2">HackerRank</a>.
            </p>
            <p id="p2">I have been also doing Web-development for some clubs in my college using HTML, CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript.</p>
            <p id="p2">That is all from the programming side. If you have some suggestions or any queries, you can write me to <a href="mailto:skrsumit250@gmail.com" id="a2">skrsumit250</a> or also I am available on social media like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/skrsumit250/" id="a2">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumit-kumar-8190a522b/" id="a2">Linkdin</a>.</p>
